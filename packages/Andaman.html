          <h4>Day 1: Port Blair: Arrival, Sightseeing Overnight Stay</h4>
          <p>
            Arrive at the Port Blair Airport, Veer Savarkar Airport; an IHPL
            representative will meet you and assist you to your hotel. The
            capital city of Andaman Islands, Port Blair, is famous for its
            pristine natural beauty and serene environment. The city offers
            fabulous views of coconut and palm trees, azure blue water and
            gleaming sand. It is one of the major tourist places in India.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you reach the hotel, complete the check-in formalities and rest
            for a while. Your 6 nights and 7 days Andaman itinerary will start
            in the daytime. You can spend time at the Water Sports Complex
            (closed on Wednesday) so plan your trip accordingly. Here, options
            to indulge in watersports activities are endless, from banana boat
            ride to glass-bottom ride, from jet ski to speed boat ride.

            Day 2: Havelock Island: Arrival by Ferry, Sightseeing, and Overnight
            Stay
          </h4>
          <p>
            This morning, wake up to the drool-worthy breakfast, complete the
            check-out formalities, and travel to Havelock Island. It is a
            must-visit place on a trip to Andaman. You will reach here by ferry.
            Here the prismatic beaches have shimmering blue water, and the
            shoreline is flanked by the palm trees. Havelock Island is one of
            the best places in Andaman to watch the underwater coral colonies.
            Upon your arrival at Havelock Island, check in at the hotel and
            relax for some time.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a few hours, visit the Blue Flag coveted Radhanagar Beach.
            Such is the allure of this beach that it has been honored as 'Asia's
            best beach by the famous 'Times Magazine.' The water quality is
            similar to the Maldives beaches. Furthermore, the visibility during
            snorkeling and scuba diving is awesome. Imagine yourself surrounded
            by a peaceful environment where white sands are your holiday
            playground. From snorkeling to swimming and other watersports are in
            abundance at Radhanagar Beach.
          </p>
          <p>

          </p>
          <p>Travel Time: 3 hours 15 minutes (approx.)</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> Your Andaman itinerary for 6 days here on day
            2 does not include the watersports cost at Radhanagar Beach. One
            must have to pay the additional cost to indulge in watersports.
          </p>
          <h4>Day 3: Havelock Island: Full Day Sightseeing</h4>
          <p>
            Begin your day with a scrumptious breakfast at your resort/hotel,
            and then lace up your sneakers to discover the top places to visit
            on Havelock Island. You would be amazed to know that Havelock Island
            (now Swaraj Dweep) has one of the best beaches in Andaman. Moreover,
            the sand here is sugary white, and the marvelous reef and rapturous
            swimming elephants could be seen because Havelock Island has lush
            green tropical vegetation.
          </p>
          <p>
            For a wholesome experience at the beaches, cover as much as the
            beaches other than Randhanagar on day 3. For instance, Elephant
            Beach is a lively beach for swimming and boating. Vijaynagar Beach
            has a relaxing aura, and the palm trees grace the setting. Also, the
            Govindnagar Beach has swanky resorts and beach restaurants to nosh
            on sea food. Enjoy snorkeling or spend the day lying on the beach
            and relaxing. The hard coral reef here starts close to shore at a
            depth of about 1 meter and has plenty of marine life.
          </p>
          <p>
            Once you are done with the Havelock Island sightseeing, return to
            the hotel/resort for overnight sleep. And yes, your dinner is also
            included!
